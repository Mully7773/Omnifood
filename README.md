## Description

This is the beautiful final project in Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course, Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS. This landing page is for a fictional company called Omnifood. The page was made with semantic HTML, modern CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript for basic functionality. The high-quality images have been compressed and the page itself has been optimized for a high performance and accessibilty score (using Lighthouse). All of the code has been thoughtfully written and best-practices were used throughout the course of the project.

The landing page features a sticky navigation bar with working links. It also contains a stylish hero section with a call-to-action button. Of course, there are many subtle animations throughout the page; the landing page itself and these animation would be better experienced by visiting the page itself. The next sections include the following: a featured in section, a how-it-works section, a meals section, a testimonials section, a pricing section, a call-to-action section, and finally a complete footer. The entire webpage is mobile responsive and includes favicons for iOS and Android devices. Ensuring browser support was another focus of this project.

I spent a great deal of time considering the layout and practicing CSS grid and flexbox to better hone my skills. All elements of design were carefully thought out and produced according to the fictional company's expectations. I very much enjoyed coding this project and I look forward to implementing what I learned here in future projects.
